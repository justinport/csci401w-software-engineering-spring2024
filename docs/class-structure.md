## Welcome to Agile Bootcamp: A Semester in the Life of a Software Engineer!

Alright, folks! We're about to embark on a journey through the world of agile software development. If you've ever wondered how real-world software engineering teams work, this semester will give you a front-row seat. Let's break it down:

### Timeframe

- We will run 8 sprints throughout the semester, each lasting two weeks.
- Each of you will be part of a team, 4 members each. In total, we'll have 6 fantastic teams working in parallel.

### A Typical Sprint Week:

- **Mondays**:
  - In-class Session (80 minutes): We start off with a bit of theory and teaching. This is where you'll grasp the concepts and techniques you'll need.
  - Collaboration Time: The latter half of our Monday sessions is dedicated to team collaboration. This is where the magic happens! Discuss, brainstorm, and start planning your tasks.

- **Mid-week**:
  - Virtual Meeting: This is your team's time to discuss the backlog, which is essentially a fancy term for "stuff we need to get done". Think of it as housekeeping – making sure you all know who's doing what.

- **End of Sprint**:
  - Retrospective Submission: At the end of every sprint, each team will reflect on what went well, what could've been better, and how to improve for the next sprint. This helps us learn and grow.

### The Journey:

Starting off, it may feel like there's a whirlwind of activities and tasks. You might think, "Can I really keep up?" But here's the thing: This is how the real-world rolls, and this environment is designed to prepare you for that.

Every great software engineer has been where you are right now. Overwhelmed at first, but gradually finding their rhythm. This experience will get you accustomed to the dynamics of a software engineering team, teaching you not just the technical aspects, but also collaboration, communication, and continuous improvement – all vital skills in the industry.

So, as we dive in, remember:

- Questions are gold: Always ask if you're unsure. It's how we learn.
- Lean on your team: You're not in this alone. Your team is your support system.
- Embrace the Challenge: The best way to learn is by doing. And you'll be doing a LOT this semester.

In a few months, you won't just have a theoretical understanding of agile; you'll have lived it. And by the end, you'll have gained invaluable experience, ready to tackle real-world software projects.

Let's start this journey and remember, every software engineer was once where you are. Let's make this semester count!

## Building Agile Teams

We'll be forming six Agile development teams, each with four members. This structure mirrors real-world Agile teams and encourages teamwork, shared responsibility, and creative problem-solving.

## Guided by an Agile Coach

I'm here as your Agile Coach to guide you through the world of Agile. My role is to help you understand and apply Agile principles effectively. I'll create a supportive environment, offer guidance, and assist teams in overcoming challenges during our sprints.

## Thriving Through Teamwork

Teamwork is at the core of Agile methodologies. As we progress, remember that challenges and conflicts are opportunities for growth. Embrace these moments as chances to learn and improve, both individually and as a team.

## Navigating Grades: Your Path Forward

Your grades will be based on two main components, each contributing to your overall growth:

1. **Contribution & Effort (75%)**:
    - This aspect reflects your active participation in team discussions, problem-solving skills, attendance, and overall teamwork.
    - It's not just about the result, but about how you collaborate, share ideas, and support your teammates.
    - We'll evaluate this continuously, sprint by sprint, reflecting your progress over time.

2. **Final Deliverable (25%)**:
    - This involves your team's combined efforts throughout the semester.
    - We'll assess this through presentations and submitted assignments.
    - Factors like clarity, quality, depth of understanding, and creativity will be important.

## Engaging in the Class Environment

In this course, you'll not only gain a deep understanding of software engineering, but also master the art of effective teamwork. Each team member plays a crucial role, contributing to the team's success. Embrace challenges, share your ideas, learn from your peers, and enjoy the process of bringing concepts to life.

## Class Participation and Evaluation Guidelines

To ensure fairness and consistency, let's outline your responsibilities and the evaluation framework.

### Your Tasks:

1. **Sprint Reflections**: At the end of each sprint, your team will provide a review of what you achieved, challenges faced, and how you resolved them.
2. **Documenting Meetings**: Keep records of all meetings. Capture key discussions, decisions, tasks, and who's responsible.
3. **On-Time Assignment Submission**: Submit assignments promptly. Delays impact both your team's progress and evaluations.

### How We'll Work:

1. **GitHub**:
    - We'll adopt an "everything as code" approach.
    - GitHub is our hub for version control, assignment submissions, and documentation, including treating documentation as code.

2. **Microsoft Teams**:
    - Our main communication tool.
    - Participate actively in discussions, ask questions, and share insights.

3. **In-Person Engagement**:
    - Regular attendance and active participation are essential.
    - Be present and contribute to class discussions.

### Evaluation Breakdown:

| Criteria                        | Weightage | Description                                                                                                                                   |
|---------------------------------|:---------:|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Contribution & Effort**       |    75%    | Assessed based on participation, teamwork, problem-solving, contributions sprint by sprint, sprint reflections, meeting notes, and software development commits. |
| **Final Deliverable**           |    25%    | Evaluated through presentations, topic understanding, assignment quality, and timely assignment submission.                                     |

Remember, while grades matter, your primary focus should be on learning and growing. Collaborate, communicate, and make the most of this team-based learning experience. You've got this!
