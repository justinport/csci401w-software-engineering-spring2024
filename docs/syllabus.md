## Course Overview

This 16-week course examines the software development process from the initial requirements analysis to operations and maintenance. Student teams will actively participate in developing a software system from its inception to delivery, employing disciplined techniques representative of the industry's best practices.

## Course Objectives

- Collaborate within a team to brainstorm, define, and implement an MVP (Minimal Viable Product).
- Gain a comprehensive understanding of the Agile Software Development Lifecycle and the tools essential for team-based projects.
- Strategically implement a software product by adhering to established software engineering principles. Our work will be categorized into three overarching phases: Conceptual, Foundational, and Feature Development.
- Effectively utilize the Agile framework for planning and task execution within teams.
- Conclude the course by delivering a detailed presentation of your software product, supported by necessary deliverables such as Product Documentation, Source Code, Builds, Pipelines, and a recorded demonstration.

## Additional Resources

Throughout the course, additional materials such as research papers, articles, and tutorials may be recommended. These resources aim to augment your understanding and provide a more rounded perspective on various topics.

## Feedback Channels

Your feedback is invaluable! We encourage ongoing communication about the course's structure, content, and delivery. Whether you have suggestions, concerns, or general feedback, please feel free to share them through MS Teams or during office hours.

In addition to these channels, we will conduct periodic surveys throughout the class to gather your feedback. This will help us understand your experience and make timely adjustments to enhance the course. Furthermore, we will incorporate Agile ceremonies, such as retrospectives, within team activities. These ceremonies provide structured opportunities for team feedback and continuous improvement in our collaborative work.


## Writing in the Disciplines (WID) Statement

CSCI 401 - Software Engineering has been designated by the Department of Computer Science and Information Systems as one of its Writing in the Disciplines (WID) courses. Students enrolled in WID courses should expect to write more than in traditional classes and to receive instruction in and feedback on their written work throughout the semester. WID courses like this one build on and extend knowledge that students gain in General Education courses such as First-Year Writing, First-Year Seminar, and Connections, as well as other departmental WID courses. This course will integrate writing as a key component of the learning process, emphasizing the development of skills necessary for effective communication in the field of software engineering.
