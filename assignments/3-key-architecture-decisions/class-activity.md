# Architectural Decision Research Activity

## Objective
To explore and decide on the architectural framework(s) for your project, focusing on the frontend, backend, and database systems.

## Instructions
- **Time Allocation:** Spend about 15-20 minutes researching potential frameworks and database systems.
- **Task:** If you haven't yet chosen a framework or database system, use this time to explore your options. If you have, use this time to further justify your choice or reconsider it based on new findings.

## Questions to Guide Your Research
1. **What are the main features and benefits of the frontend frameworks you are considering?** (Examples: React, Angular, Vue.js)
2. **What backend frameworks could best support your project's needs?** (Examples: Express.js for Node.js, Django for Python, Ruby on Rails for Ruby)
3. **Which database system fits your data model and why?** (Examples: MongoDB for NoSQL, PostgreSQL for relational data)
4. **Considering your team's skills and learning goals, which technologies align best with your project?**
5. **How do community support and resources factor into your decision?**
6. **Reflect on the potential for future adaptability and scalability. Which choices leave room for growth?**
