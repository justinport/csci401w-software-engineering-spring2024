# Setting Up Trello for Class Collaboration

Trello is a popular task management and collaboration platform. For this course, we'll be utilizing Trello boards for team collaboration. Below is a step-by-step guide to help you set up a Trello account using your Rhode Island College email and get started with team boards.

## 1. Account Creation

### Step 1.1: Go to Trello's Sign-Up Page
- Visit [Trello's sign-up page](https://trello.com/signup).

### Step 1.2: Click on "Continue with Microsoft"
- Instead of filling in the sign-up form, click on the "Continue with Microsoft" button.

### Step 1.3: Enter Your Rhode Island College Email
- Input your Rhode Island College email, which should be a Microsoft account, and click "Next."

### Step 1.4: Complete the Sign-Up Process
- Follow the on-screen prompts to complete the account creation.

## 2. Setting Up a Team Board

Once you've been assigned to a team:

### Step 2.1: Create a New Board
- From your Trello dashboard, click on the "+" button in the top right-hand corner and select "Create Board."
- Name the board according to your project or team name.

### Step 2.2: Set the Board to 'Team'
- Once the board is created, click on the board's current visibility setting (default might be "Private"). Change it to "Team." This ensures only team members can see and edit the board.

### Step 2.3: Invite Team Members
- On the right-hand side, click on "Invite to board."
- Input the Rhode Island College emails of your teammates.
- They will receive an invitation to join the board and can accept it once they've set up their Trello account.

### Step 2.4: Start Collaborating
- Use lists to categorize tasks, such as "To Do," "In Progress," and "Done."
- Create cards for individual tasks and assign them to team members.
- Utilize labels, due dates, and comments to efficiently manage and communicate about tasks.

## 3. Best Practices for Collaboration

- **Regularly Update Your Cards**: Ensure that tasks' statuses are updated frequently so the entire team knows the progress.
- **Use Labels**: Trello provides colored labels that can be used for priority levels, types of tasks, or any other categorization you deem useful.
- **Hold Accountability**: Assign tasks to individual team members to ensure responsibility.
- **Engage in Conversations**: Use the comment section under each card to discuss specific tasks. This keeps all related conversations in one place.
- **Integrate with Other Tools**: Trello allows integrations with many tools like Slack, Google Drive, etc. If your team uses other platforms, consider integrating them with Trello for a smoother workflow.

## 4. Integrating with Microsoft Teams

Microsoft Teams is a collaboration platform that integrates with various third-party services, including Trello. For a seamless workflow, you can integrate your Trello board directly into your assigned Microsoft Teams channel. Here's how:

### Step 4.1: Open Microsoft Teams
- Launch the Microsoft Teams application or log in through the web interface.

### Step 4.2: Choose Your Team Channel
- Navigate to the left sidebar and select the specific channel assigned to your team.

### Step 4.3: Add a Tab for Trello
- At the top of your channel, click on the "+" icon to add a new tab.
- From the list of available apps, search and select "Trello."

### Step 4.4: Log in to Trello (if prompted)
- If prompted, log in to your Trello account using your Rhode Island College email (through Microsoft).

### Step 4.5: Choose a Board
- After logging in, you'll be prompted to pick a Trello board to integrate. Choose the board you created for your team.

### Step 4.6: Finalize the Integration
- Follow any additional on-screen prompts to finalize the integration.

Once integrated, team members can view and interact with the Trello board directly from Microsoft Teams. This allows for easy access, quick updates, and a unified workspace, making collaboration even more efficient.
