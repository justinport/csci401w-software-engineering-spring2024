# Guide to Agile User Stories and Trello Management

## Introduction

This guide is designed to help you, as students of software engineering, transform your product personas and stories assignment into actionable user stories, clear acceptance criteria, and effectively manage these tasks using Trello. The goal is to ensure that your project is well-organized, and your team has a clear understanding of what needs to be accomplished.

## Writing Clear Acceptance Criteria

### What is Acceptance Criteria?

Acceptance criteria are conditions that a software product must satisfy to be accepted by a user, customer, or other stakeholders. They are a key part of user stories that help ensure everyone has a shared understanding of what the story must do.

### Why is it Important?

- **Clarifies Expectations**: Ensures all team members understand what is expected from a user story.
- **Facilitates Testing**: Provides a basis for tests that will be performed to validate the story.
- **Guides Development**: Helps developers know when the story is complete.

### How to Write Clear Acceptance Criteria

1. **Be Specific**: Use precise language to avoid ambiguity.
2. **Keep it Simple**: Write in simple, understandable terms.
3. **Use Bullet Points**: List each criterion separately for clarity.
4. **Include Functional and Non-functional Requirements**: Cover both what the feature does and how it performs.
5. **Focus on the Outcome**: Describe the end result, not how to achieve it.

## Breaking Up Stories

### When to Break Up a Story

- **Too Complex**: If a story is too large or complex, it's hard to estimate and manage.
- **Learning Curve**: If implementing the story requires learning new technologies, consider creating separate learning stories.
- **Setting Up Foundations**: For tasks like setting up databases or other foundational elements, create individual stories.

### Tips for Breaking Up Stories

- **By Workflow Steps**: Divide the story based on the steps a user takes.
- **By Operations**: If a story includes CRUD operations (create, read, update, delete), consider breaking it up.
- **By Acceptance Criteria**: If a story has too many acceptance criteria, it might need to be split.

## Using Trello for Agile Project Management

### Setting Up Your Board

1. **Create a New Board**: Name it after your project.
2. **Add Lists**: Start with "To Do", "In Progress", "Review", and "Done".
3. **Add Cards**: Each user story becomes a card. Place them in the "To Do" list initially.

### Managing User Stories on Trello

1. **Writing User Stories**: Summarize the story in the card title. Add detailed descriptions and acceptance criteria in the card description.
2. **Assigning Tasks**: Assign cards to team members. Use labels for categorizing stories by features or priorities.
3. **Tracking Progress**: Move cards across lists as work progresses from "To Do" to "Done".

### Creating Clear Acceptance Criteria in Trello

- **Use the Description Field**: Write your acceptance criteria in the card’s description.
- **Checklists for Criteria**: Trello allows you to add checklists to cards. Use this feature to list acceptance criteria, making it easy to track when criteria are met.

## Concrete Examples of User Stories with Acceptance Criteria

### Example 1: User Login

**User Story**: As a pizza app user, I want to log in to my account so I can access my order history and saved preferences.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- The login screen is accessible from the app's main screen.
- Users can log in using an email and password.
- Incorrect login attempts display an error message.
- Successful login redirects the user to their profile page.

### Example 2: Ordering Pizza

**User Story**: As a customer, I want to select a pizza size, choose toppings, and add it to my cart so I can customize my order.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Users can select from available pizza sizes.
- Users can add and remove toppings from a predefined list.
- The current price updates as options are selected or changed.
- Users can add the customized pizza to their cart.

### Example 3: Payment Process

**User Story**: As a customer, I want to securely enter my payment information and place my order so I can receive my pizza.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- The app provides fields for entering credit card information or selecting other payment methods.
- Payment information is validated upon submission.
- Users receive a confirmation screen with an order number and estimated delivery time after a successful payment.
- The app implements security measures to protect users' payment information.

## Conclusion

By following this guide, you’ll be able to effectively transform your assignment into a well-organized Trello board with clear user stories and acceptance criteria. This will not only help in managing your project more efficiently but also ensure that all team members have a shared understanding of what needs to be achieved for successful project completion.
